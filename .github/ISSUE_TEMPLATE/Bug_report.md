# READ IF YOU HAVE MODS

**Note**: If you have mods installed, DO NOT submit a bug report. The chances of one of these mods causing the issue is very high, and so, such bug reports are worthless to us.

No, I am not using any modes besides the required ones.

## Description

When using conjure familar there is a dead NPC left behind. This is only visible when you leave and re-enter the room. This can lead to some pretty full rooms.

## Steps to reproduce

How to reproduce this issue. Be as specific as possible and try to only include instructions you believe are necessary to reproduce said issue, i.e.

1. Use conjure familar in a fight with npc, with other players involved.
2. Change area (say Whiterun > leave out the gate)
3. Re-enter the area (enter through gate > Whiterun)
4. There will now be wolf npc models in a default position where the spell was cast / where the wolf despawned or died. (This is not affected by where the area is as far as I have seen)

## Reproduction rate

Please check just _one_ of the following reproduction rates:

- [x ] Consistent: I can reproduce this bug by following the steps to reproduce 100% of the time (*every time*)
- [ ] Occasional: I can reproduce this bug by following the steps to reproduce around 50% of the time
- [ ] Rare: I can reproduce this bug by following the steps to reproduce around 10% or less of the time

<!---
Friendly Tip: most bugs are in fact 100% reproducible - it's nailing down the precise reproduction steps that is the hard part! Bugs that are 80-100% reproducible will save the developers a lot of time and energy and they tend to get more attention too. If you have the time, try and figure out the exact reproduction steps and everybody will benefit. This text will not appear in the actual bug report but is visible to people creating new issues - feel free to remove it if you like.

## Expected result

The conjured wolf should dissapear after spell is over.
